# Graph
A java interface for graphs along with an abstract class.  Will include an implementation of unweighted and weighted graphs.
Note that edges must be addes symmetrically to get an undirected graph for the abstract class.  
Note adding the same edge twice is possible but will increase space used and make implementation slower.

This was an exercise from the book, Introduction to Java Programming Comprehensive Edition by Y. Daniel Liang
